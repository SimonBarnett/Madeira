## Proposal: Flight Instructor Product Reviews  
We propose a unique and engaging approach to integrating Amazon Affiliate links into our website.

We regularly host events such as open flying days, workshops, and demonstrations to introduce model aviation to people of all ages. Our club also proudly partners with the local Air Cadets, providing mentorship, flight training opportunities, and hands-on experiences with model aircraft. Through this collaboration, we inspire the next generation of aviation enthusiasts and contribute to youth development in Merseyside.  

By joining the Amazon Affiliate Program, we aim to reinvest earnings into these community efforts—expanding our outreach, funding equipment for Air Cadet programs, and offering more free or subsidized workshops for local residents. This aligns with our mission to make model aviation accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
